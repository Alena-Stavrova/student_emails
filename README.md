# student_emails
This is another practical task in SQL (MySQL) that I think may come handy. 

We have a simple table of student names, surnames and schools (as numbers). We want to create emails for each student so that it contains the student's first and last name (separated by a dot), "at" sign and then the school's website in Russia, e.g. the word "school" with the number of that school (like @school20.ru). 
To make it a little more interesting, let's only create emails for the students who study in schools with two-digit numbers.

The similar query can be used, for example, for creating professional emails for employees.
